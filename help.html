				    <h2>A Brief Introduction</h2>
				    <h4>What is an RNA Triplet</h4>
				    <p class="mainpara"> 
				    Ribonucleic Acids (RNA) are a single chain nucleic acid sequences. To stebilize 
				    its structures, it creates base-base interactions or base pairing. Some times one base interacts or forms
				    base pairs with more than one bases (e.g C=G=A. here the central guanine forms a pair
				    with C and another pair with A). In such cases we call them base triplets.

				    </p>

				    <h4>Why are they biologically important?</h4>
				    <p class="mainpara">Specific interactions between nucleotide bases are extremely important for formation of various well defined structures of the different functional RNA, such as Ribosome, tRNA, etc. These specific interactions take place in the form of base pairing assisted by couple of hydrogen bonds between the two participating bases. Furthermore, base pairing in RNA is not restricted within Watson-Crick type A:U and G:C only but various non-canonical base pairs are quite often observed in the available structures of RNA. Such non-canonical base pairing may involve the Hoogsteen edge of especially the purines (where hydrogen bonds are possible using N7 atoms of the purines as acceptors) or sugar edge of the bases, also involving 2'-OH group of ribose sugars. Either of the bases of these base pairs can further specifically interact with another base of the RNA forming base triplets. Such base triplets or even higher order structures have been observed quite frequently. Non-canonical base pairing is mandatory in these base triplets. The present database attempts to provide several additonal information about the base triplets found in RNA crystal structures.

				    <h4>Different types Triplets</h4>
				    <p>
				    There are different types of triplets.

                     <ol>
                        <li>
                         Bases not having coordinates of all the ring atoms (purine/pyrimidine) and
      C1' atoms are not considered for detecting hydrogen bonds.
                         </li>
                         
                         <li>
                         At least two hydrogen bonds must exist between two bases, at least one of
      which must be between the base moieties. Basepairs involving both 2'-OH 
      mediated hydrogen bonds are not detected by BPFind. It considers basepairs
      for which both the H-bonds are of C-H...O/N type, as long as one H-bond is
      found between the base rings.

                         Our databse considers a range of modified bases which are usually under the 
      'HETATM' lines in a PDB file.
      
                         </li>
                         
                         <li>
                         BPFind uses a cutoff distance of 3.8 angstrom between the acceptor and 
      donor atoms, a cutoff angle of 120.0 degree for checking planarity of 
      precursor atoms (designed carefully to accommodate more labile basepairs) 
      and a cutoff E-value of 1.8 to signify the overall distortion and maintain
      a good basepairing geometry.  This file contains several columns, their
      descriptions are given on top header starting "#"
                         </li>
                         
                         
                         <li>
                         BPFind uses a more stringent option for protonated basepair options in 
      order to avoid false positives. It considers cutoff angle of 150.0 degree
      for protonated basepairs.
                         </li>
                         <li>
                         BPFind allows more flexibility if 2'-OH of the ribose sugar moiety is 
      involved in hydrogen bonding, the cutoff angle considered is 100.0 degree.
                         </li>
                         
                         <li>
                         In case of structures with multiple occupancy of some atoms, the positions with 
      highest occupancy is considered. If the positions of highest occupancy is 
      less than 0.5, the atomic position is ignored. When two atoms have identical 
      occupancy of 0.5, the first atomic position is considered.
